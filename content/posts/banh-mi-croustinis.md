## Directions

### For the baguette

This recipe is something I've compiled from two different sources. The first is
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yp8UhNnj-w), which I drew on to
figure out the baguette-specific components of the recipe: the folding, the
resting times, the baking duration, *etc.* The other source is [this
book](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast) by Ken Forkish. While I
haven't tried other books, I highly recommend this one as an effective
introduction to making great bread.

* Make a poolish the night before. Add 1/8 tsp instant yeast to 500 g bread
  flour in a 6 quart container and mix. Next, add 500 g water (with a
  temperature of roughly 30 degrees Celsius). Let sit 12 -- 14 hours or until 2
  -- 3x its original size.
  
* When the poolish is ready, add 500 g bread flour to a 12 quart container. Add
  3 g instant dry yeast and 21 g salt. Mix well.

* To the 6 quart container, add 250 g of approximately 41 degree Celsius
  water. If you pour it around the edges it will help to un-stick the poolish
  from its container. 
  
* Pour the poolish slurry into the 12 quart container and mix well by hand,
  ensuring there are no lumps. Next begins the folding and resting phase.
  
* If you plan to add garlic to the baguette, now is the time! Add and fold to
  ensure it distributes evenly.
  
* Let the dough rise for the next 2.5 -- 3 hours. During this time, the dough
  will require 3 -- 4 folds to build its strength. It's easiest to do the folds
  in the first hour or so (e.g., every 20 -- 25 minutes, fold all four corners
  of the dough to their opposite sides). After the second or third fold, you
  should notice that the dough is better able to retain its shape.
  
* Once the dough has risen in volume to 2 -- 3 times its size, it's time to cut
  and portion the dough. With a dough scraper, cut the dough into 4 equal sized
  pieces (roughly 443 g each).

* Give the dough an initial shape by stretching, folding the sides into the
  centre, and then sealing the top to the bottom against the working
  surface. [See here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yp8UhNnj-w) for an
  excellent video description. They should now look elongated --- vaguely
  baguette shaped, even!
  
* Set your oven to 500 Celsius and start the pre-heating process. Make sure
  your pizza stone is in place if you're using one, otherwise set a baking tray
  on the oven rack so that it heats.
  
* Once the rough-shaped doughs have rested another 15 minutes, it's time to do
  the final shaping.
  
* Shape the dough into baguette form. Use the pushing and rolling technique as
  seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yp8UhNnj-w).
  
* Let the baguettes rest another 45 minutes. Ensure they are supported on both
  sides so that they rise up and don't flop to the side.
  
* Top with flaked maldon salt, if desired. 

* Score the loaves and insert them into the oven. Bake for 15 minutes or until
  they just start to acquire some burn-ish spots. I find that throwing an ice
  cube or two into the bottom of the oven helps to keep the oven humidity up,
  which aids crust formation.
  
* Enjoy!


### For the pickled veg

You'll want to start this the night before, too, so that the veggies have time
to absorb the flavour of the pickling solution.

* Boil some water. 

* In the meantime, cut the carrot, daikon and cucumber into spears. Cut the
  jalapeno into rounds. Insert them into a jar. Inserting them aligned allows
  you to fit more, and it looks nicer too!

* Mix the boiled water, rice vinegar, salt and water in a container. 

* Add the liquid mixture to the jar of veg. Let the liquid cool for an hour,
  and then store in the fridge overnight.
  
### Assembly

* If you're using smoked tofu, it goes great just the way it is. Slice it up
  and get ready to put it on some fresh rounds of baguette.
  
* Cut the baguette into rondelles. If you want to toast the fresh baguette
  slices, you can put them in the oven at 400 Celsius for 2--5 minutes. 
  
* Top the baguette with: vegan mayo, a slice or two of smoked tofu, some
  pickled veggies, and a few drops (or light drizzle) or sriracha.
  
* Enjoy!
