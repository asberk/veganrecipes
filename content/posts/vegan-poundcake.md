## Ingredients

### Loaf

 * 1 cup sugar
 * zest of one orange/lime/lemon
 * 1/2 cup olive/coconut oil (liquid)
 * 2 flax eggs / 1 banana
 * 1/2 cup vegan buttermilk
 * dash vanilla/almond extract/brandy
 * 1/4 tsp nutmeg
 * 1/4 tsp salt
 * 1/4 tsp baking soda
 * 1 tsp baking powder
 * 1/2 cup cornmeal
 * 1.25 cups flour
 
### Spread

 * 1/4 cup vegan butter
 * 1/8 cup sugar
 * pinch cinnamon
 * pinch salt
 * pinch chili powder

## Directions

 Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease a loaf pan. In a big bowl, add a cup of
 sugar. Grate and whisk the zest into the bowl. 
 
 Add the wet ingredients to the bowl:

  * 1/2 cup liquid fat 
  * 2 flax eggs, 
  * 1/2 cup vegan buttermilk 
  * a dash of vanilla, almond extract and/or brandy
  * 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

 Whisk in the dry ingredients in this order: 

  * 1/4 teaspoon salt, 
  * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 
  * 1 teaspoon baking powder
  * 1/2 cup cornmeal
  
 Once smooth, whisk in:

  * 1 1/4 cups flour.

 Finally, scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 45-60 minutes.
 
 While it's baking, combine the following in a small bowl and mix well:

 * 1/4 cup vegan butter
 * 1/8 cup sugar
 * pinch cinnamon
 * pinch salt
 * pinch chili powder 
 
 This stuff makes a phenomenal spread. When the loaf has finished baking, let it
 (mostly) cool in the pan. Slice off a thick piece, butter it and enjoy!
